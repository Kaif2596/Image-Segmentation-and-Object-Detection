# Image Segmentation and Object Detection

Image Segmentation and Object Analysis

1.) Overview

This project is an image segmentation and captioning pipeline built using Streamlit and various models from the Hugging Face library. The application allows users to upload an image, which is then processed to detect objects and generate captions. It uses the following models:
- **DetrForObjectDetection**: For object detection.
- **CLIPModel**: For generating captions using CLIP.
- **BlipForConditionalGeneration**: For generating captions using BLIP.

2.) Features

- **Object Detection**: Identifies and labels objects in the uploaded image.
- **Caption Generation**: Provides captions for the uploaded image using two different models (CLIP and BLIP).

3.) Setup Instructions

4.) Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

5.) Installation

a.) **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

b.) **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv newenv
    ```

c.) **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - **Windows**

        ```bash
        .\newenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

    - **MacOS/Linux**

        ```bash
        source newenv/bin/activate
        ```

d.) **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Ensure `requirements.txt` contains:
    ```txt
    streamlit
    torch
    transformers
    pillow
    ```

6.) Usage

a.) **Run the Streamlit Application**

    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

b.) **Upload an Image**

    - Open the web browser at the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
    - Use the file uploader to select an image (JPG, JPEG, PNG).

c.) **View Results**

    - The application will display the uploaded image.
    - Detected objects and their labels will be listed.
    - Captions generated by CLIP and BLIP models will be shown.
